                <h2 class="h2_what_is"><u>What is Mardi Gras</u> </h2>
                <p class="p_what_is">Mardi Gras, or Fat Tuesday, refers to events of the Carnival celebration, beginning
                    on
                    or after the
                    Christian feasts of
                    the Epiphany (Three Kings Day) and culminating on the day before Ash Wednesday, which is known as
                    Shrove
                    Tuesday.

                    Mardi Gras is French for "Fat Tuesday", reflecting the practice of the last night of eating rich,
                    fatty
                    foods before the
                    ritual Lenten sacrifices and fasting of the Lenten season.

                    Related popular practices are associated with Shrovetide celebrations before the fasting and
                    religious
                    obligations
                    associated with the penitential season of Lent.

                    In countries such as the United Kingdom, Mardi Gras is also known as Shrove Tuesday, which is
                    derived
                    from the word
                    shrive, meaning "to administer the sacrament of confession to; to absolve"

                    Some think Mardi Gras may be linked with the ancient Roman pagan celebrations of spring and
                    fertility
                    such as
                    Saturnalia, which dates back to 133–31 BC. This celebration honored the god of agriculture, Saturn.
                    It
                    was observed in
                    mid-December, before the sowing of winter crops. It was a week-long festival when work and business
                    came
                    to a halt.
                    Schools and courts of law closed, and the normal social patterns were suspended.

                    On the Julian calendar, which the Romans used at the time, the winter solstice fell on December 25.
                    Hence, the
                    celebration gradually became associated with Christmas.</p>

                <h2 class="h2_history"><u>History</u></h2>
                <P class="p_history">The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing through Rome
                    and
                    Venice in the 17th
                    and 18th
                    centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf Gras,"
                    or
                    fatted calf,
                    followed France to her colonies. On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne
                    Sieur
                    de Bienville
                    arrived at a plot of ground 60 miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi
                    Gras"
                    when his men
                    realized it was the eve of the festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la
                    Louisiane"
                    (which is now
                    Mobile) in 1702. In 1703, the tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated America's very
                    first
                    Mardi Gras.


                    In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those that form our
                    current Mardi Gras
                    krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and paraded from 1711
                    through
                    1861. The
                    procession was held with a huge bull's head pushed along on wheels by 16 men. Later, Rex would
                    parade
                    with an actual
                    bull, draped in white and signaling the coming Lenten meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday. New
                    Orleans was
                    established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated openly in New Orleans, but
                    not
                    with the
                    parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil,
                    established
                    elegant society
                    balls, which became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras balls of today.


                    The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish colonial
                    governing body. That
                    year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of hundreds of clubs and
                    carnival organizations
                    formed in New Orleans. By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with
                    carriages
                    and horseback
                    riders to celebrate Mardi Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the
                    krewe's
                    members and lent
                    each event an exciting air of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed the
                    Mistick Krewe of
                    Comus, invoking John Milton's hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus brought magic and
                    mystery to New Orleans
                    with dazzling floats (known as tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe members remained anonymous.

                <P class="p_tradition">Mardi Gras is about music, parades, picnics, floats and excitement. It's one big
                    holiday in New Orleans!
                    Revelers know
                    to wear costumes or at least dress in purple, green, and gold, and adorn themselves with long beads
                    caught from the
                    floats of previous parades. You'll see a lot of crazy costumes, kids with their families are
                    everywhere,
                    and both locals
                    and visitors having a great time. Parade goers will sit on the ground, throw balls, play music, eat
                    great food and watch
                    the crowds walk by between parades. On Mardi Gras day, the majority of non-essential businesses are
                    shut
                    down because of
                    the celebration. Experienced revelers know to bring a large bag with them so they can haul away all
                    the
                    beads and
                    trinkets they will catch from the parades! Every year, we get a lot of questions about how it all
                    begin,

                        the year. We invite everyone to experience Mardi Gras at least once in their lifetime. Make your
                        plans now to be a part
                        of this great tradition and see firsthand why we say, "Laissez les bon temps rouler!"

                        sincerely,

                        LaToya Cantrell
                        Mayor of New Orleans</p>
